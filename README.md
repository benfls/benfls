Hello, 

I am benfls, a student at ISIMA in Clermont-Ferrand, specializing in Decision Support Systems. I am entering my third year of engineering school and will begin a dual degree program focused on studying the latest cutting-edge technologies in decision support systems and data science.

I am interested in data analysis and machine learning. I have completed several personal projects, such as creating a GPT model and a visual tracking model, to acquire new skills in artificial intelligence and data processing. I also completed a 5-month internship at Apex-Solutions in Cambes (46), where I developed various intelligent models for trajectory prediction and shock wave suppression during diffraction and reflection.

I am currently seeking an end-of-study internship abroad, starting in early April 2025. During this internship, I would like to deepen the knowledge I have already acquired in data science and AI/ML.

I can be reached at the following email address: ben.flous300502@gmail.com for more information and potential internship opportunities.

Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to consider my application and contact me for internship opportunities.

Best regards,

benfls
